Please, substitute '??' by your fedora release number

Please, put the vmlinuz and initrd.img into a F??-x86_64 directory; on this level. You can find these @ http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/??/Fedora/x86_64/os/images/pxeboot/

Also, you need to copy:
- pxelinux.0
- splash.xpm.gz
- vesamenu.c32

find out where to get this files by using:
    yum provides '*/pxelinux.0'
    yum provides '*/splash.xpm.gz'
    yum provides '*/vesamenu.c32'

Put all these files at this level; specifically: /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux

Also, you will have to fix the pxelinux.cfg/default file.
