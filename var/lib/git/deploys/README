Deploys are a special kind of git bare repo.

Basically, you add a post-receive hook with a line like: GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/zendframework/example.tld/default/public git checkout -f

This line reflects the files in the repo to that destination.

Another idea is to use: GIT_WORK_TREE=/ git checkout -f

If a propper FHS structure is maintained, you will be able to manage a server with this. It will overwrite the followed files.
