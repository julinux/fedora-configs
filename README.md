Description
===========
This repository is a configurations repository. It intends to have example configurations of most used apps in Fedora; respecting the "Fedorian Way" of doing thigs.

Phylosophy
==========
IMHO, most HowTos and recommendations, work "against" the distro. The phylosophy of this project is to work "in favour" of the distribution; leveraging from all the integration and security it already brings.

Collaboration
=============
This is a new project and collaboration is very welcome.
